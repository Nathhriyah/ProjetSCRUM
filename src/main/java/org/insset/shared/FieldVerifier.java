/**

 * <p>
 * This class is in the <code>shared</code> packing because we use it in both
 * the client code and on the server. On the client, we verify that the name is
 * valid before sending an RPC request so the user doesn't have to wait for a
 * network round trip to get feedback. On the server, we verify that the name is
 * correct to ensure that the input is correct regardless of where the RPC
 * originates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When creating a class that is used on both the client and the server, be sure
 * that all code is translatable and does not use native JavaScript. Code that
 * is note translatable (such as code that interacts with a database or the file
 * system) cannot be compiled into client side JavaScript. Code that uses native
 * JavaScript (such as Widgets) cannot be run on the server.
